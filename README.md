# Data-Bias
This is my public Git Repository for I310D Coding Assignment 3

After reading about how the Perspective API can measure how offesnive a comment is in multiple langauages, **my hypothesis for this porject was to compare weather the API is able to accurately measure toxic and non-toxic comments Hindi (Hinglish) equally as well as it would be able to when translated in English.** I feel that it's pretty safe to assume that the Perspective API can more accurately score toxic and non-toxic statements written in English whihch I why I believe that the Perspective API would be able to more accurately score statements in English than in in Hindi (Hinglish).

Write a few paragraphs, either in the README or in the notebook, reflecting on what you have learned, what you found, what (if anything) surprised you about your findings, and/or what theories you have about why any biases might exist, if you find they exist. You can also include any questions this assignment raised for you about bias or machine learning. Questions you may wish to answer include:

What biases do you think might exist in the model based on intuitions or public documentation about how the model was created?
What were your results?
What theories do you have about why your results are what they are?
